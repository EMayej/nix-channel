** install git hooks
#+begin_src sh
  lefthook add pre-commit
#+end_src
** build a package
For example, to build ~gost~:
#+begin_src sh
  nix-build . -A gost
#+end_src
** upgrade a package
For instance, if we want to update ~adguardhome~ to ~0.106.0~:
#+begin_src sh
niv update adguardhome -v 0.106.0
#+end_src

It looks like ~niv~ decompress the file downloaded and then generate a hash,
while the actually hash used is against the compressed file. Thus we have to fix
the hash after ~niv update~. See this [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Hash][link]] for more details.
